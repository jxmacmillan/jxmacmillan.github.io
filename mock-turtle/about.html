        <h2>About the Mock Turtle Club</h2>
        <p>    Mock Turtle is a club which publishes students' work. This could be drawing, writing, or anything else. The art that is chosen by the club is published every year in a magazine. </p>
        <h2>The Name</h2>
        <p>    In Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, Alice meets a character known as the Mock Turtle, displayed in the top banner of this page. Mock Turtle soup was a soup made to taste like turtle soup but which did not contain turtle, presumably due to lack of turtles to cook. Now, the mock turtle club is an amalgamation of all different kinds of art. </p>
